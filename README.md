# principios-solid-php


hi there! this is a repository for the principles of SOLID in PHP.  it's an example project to show how these five design principles from object-oriented programming can be used to create a circus.


## Principle of Single Responsibility (SRP):
 states that a class should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility or task. 

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
This principle suggests that entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In a circus, this could translate to designing performances and acts that can be easily extended or modified without the need to alter the entire show. For example, a juggling act could be extended by adding more juggling objects, but without needing to rewrite the entire act.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
This principle states that objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program. 

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. 

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
This principle suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather on abstractions.
